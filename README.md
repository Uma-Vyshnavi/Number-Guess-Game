#  Number Guess Game â€“ Python

A terminal-based Python game where users guess a randomly generated number within limited attempts. Built to simulate pair programming principles and practice clean coding.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Difficulty levels: Easy (1â€“10), Medium (1â€“50), Hard (1â€“100)
- Score system (starts at 100, deducts for wrong guesses)
- Input validation and feedback (Too high / Too low)
- Modular and testable code

## ðŸ’¡ Concepts Used
- Python Basics (input, print, loops, conditions)
- Random number generation
- Functions and modular logic
- Error handling (`try/except`)
- Pair programming mindset

## ðŸš€ How to Run
python number_guess_game.py
